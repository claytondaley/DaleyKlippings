This file tells the DaleyKlippings executable that this is a portable installation 
of the DaleyKlippings program.

If you do not leave this file in place, the program will attempt to write the 
settings file to the current user's application data folder (the precise folder 
will depend on your OS).  In most cases, this is undesirable because your settings
will be left behind when you move this folder to a new location.
